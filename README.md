# Imperial Instruments: Designing a Microfluidic Device to Evaluate Cell Viability Under Shear Rates

[![Imperial College London](https://img.shields.io/badge/Imperial%20College-London-003E74)](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bioengineering/)
This repository contains the final report, CAD files, and supplementary materials for the "Imperial Instruments" project, undertaken at the Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London.The project focuses on designing and validating a microfluidic device to effectively evaluate cell viability when exposed to various shear rates, a critical factor in the success of cell therapies. 

## TLDR (Want a summary?)

* We are making injections safer for cells! 
* Low cell survival during injection causes therapies to fail.
* We have developed a microfluidic device to test exactly how much shear rate cells can handle.
* This helps us find safer limits, leading to more effective and efficient injection systems.
* This will get more healthy cells where they need to go.

## Repository Contents

This repository primarily contains:

* **Final Report:** A comprehensive document detailing the project's background, methodology, results, and conclusions.
* **CAD Files:** Design files for the microfluidic device. [cite: 10]
* **Other Deliverables:** Mindmap, Brochure and Literature reviews

## Usage

The CAD files can be used to fabricate the microfluidic device. The final report provides context and details of the experimental setup and findings. If simulation scripts are included, they may require appropriate software to run.
